This module provides a client-side interface to the File Transfer Protocol
as defined by RFC959 and RFC1123.

Written by John Goerzen, jgoerzen\@complete.org

Welcome to the FTP module for Haskell.

Here is a quick usage example to get you started.  This is a log of a real
session with ghci: 

(This would be similar in a @do@ block.  You could also save it to a file and
run that with Hugs.)

> Prelude> :l Network.FTP.Client
> ...

The above loads the module.

Next, we enable the debugging.  This will turn on all the @FTP sent@ and
@FTP received@ messages you'll see.

> Prelude Network.FTP.Client> enableFTPDebugging

Now, connect to the server on @ftp.kernel.org@.

> *Network.FTP.Client> h <- easyConnectFTP "ftp.kernel.org"
> FTP received: 220 Welcome to ftp.kernel.org.

And log in anonymously.

> *Network.FTP.Client> loginAnon h
> FTP sent: USER anonymous
> FTP received: 331 Please specify the password.
> FTP sent: PASS anonymous@
> ...
> FTP received: 230 Login successful.

Change the directory...

> Prelude Network.FTP.Client> cwd h "/pub/linux/kernel/Historic"
> FTP sent: CWD /pub/linux/kernel/Historic
> FTP received: 250 Directory successfully changed.

Let's look at the directory. 'nlst' returns a list of strings, each string
corresponding to a filename.  Here, @putStrLn . unlines@ will simply
print them out, one per line.

> Prelude Network.FTP.Client> nlst h Nothing >>= putStrLn . unlines
> FTP sent: TYPE A
> FTP received: 200 Switching to ASCII mode.
> FTP sent: PASV
> FTP received: 227 Entering Passive Mode (204,152,189,116,130,143)
> FTP sent: NLST
> FTP received: 150 Here comes the directory listing.
> linux-0.01.tar.bz2
> linux-0.01.tar.bz2.sign
> linux-0.01.tar.gz
> linux-0.01.tar.gz.sign
> linux-0.01.tar.sign
> old-versions
> v0.99
> FTP received: 226 Directory send OK.

Let's try downloading something and print it to the screen.  Again, we use
@putStrLn@.  We use @fst@ here because 'getbinary' returns a tuple consisting
of a string representing the data and a 'FTPResult' code.

> Prelude Network.FTP.Client> getbinary h "linux-0.01.tar.gz.sign" >>= putStrLn . fst
> FTP sent: TYPE I
> FTP received: 200 Switching to Binary mode.
> FTP sent: PASV
> FTP received: 227 Entering Passive Mode (204,152,189,116,121,121)
> FTP sent: RETR linux-0.01.tar.gz.sign

> FTP received: 226 File send OK.

Here's an example showing you what the result code looks like.

> Prelude Network.FTP.Client> getbinary h "linux-0.01.tar.gz.sign" >>= print . snd
> ...
> (226,["File send OK."])

The first component of the 'FTPResult' object is the numeric status code from
the server.  The second component is a list of message lines from the server.

Now, let's get a more detailed directory listing:

> Prelude Network.FTP.Client> dir h Nothing >>= putStrLn . unlines
> ...
> -r--r--r--    1 536      536         63362 Oct 30  1993 linux-0.01.tar.bz2
> -r--r--r--    1 536      536           248 Oct 30  1993 linux-0.01.tar.bz2.sign
> -r--r--r--    1 536      536         73091 Oct 30  1993 linux-0.01.tar.gz
> -r--r--r--    1 536      536           248 Oct 30  1993 linux-0.01.tar.gz.sign
> -r--r--r--    1 536      536           248 Oct 30  1993 linux-0.01.tar.sign
> drwxrwsr-x    5 536      536          4096 Mar 20  2003 old-versions
> drwxrwsr-x    2 536      536          4096 Mar 20  2003 v0.99
> FTP received: 226 Directory send OK.

And finally, log out:

> Prelude Network.FTP.Client> quit h
> FTP sent: QUIT
> FTP received: 221 Goodbye.

Here is one big important caution:

/You MUST consume all data from commands that return file data before you
issue any other FTP commands./

That's due to the lazy nature of Haskell.  This means that, for instance,
you can't just iterate over the items 'nlst' returns, trying to 'getbinary'
each one of them -- the system is still transferring 'nlst' data while you
are trying that, and confusion will ensue.  Either open two FTP connections
or make sure you consume the 'nlst' data first.

Here is a partial list of commands effected: 'nlst', 'dir', 'getbinary',
'getlines', 'downloadbinary'.

The 'Data.List.Utils.seqList' function could be quite helpful here.  For instance:

> x <- nlst h Nothing
> map (\fn -> ...download files from FTP... ) (seqList x)

If you omit the call to 'Data.List.Utils.seqList', commands to download files
will be issued before the entire directory listing is read.  FTP cannot handle
this.

The corrolary is:

/Actions that yield lazy data for data uploading must not issue FTP
commands themselves./

This will be fairly rare.  Just be aware of this.

This module logs messages under @Network.FTP.Client@ for outgoing
traffic and @Network.FTP.Client.Parser@ for incoming traffic, all with the
'System.Log.DEBUG' priority, so by default, no log messages are seen.
The 'enableFTPDebugging' function will adjust the priorities of these
two handlers so debug messages are seen.  Only control channel conversations
are logged.  Data channel conversations are never logged.

All exceptions raised by this module have a string beginning with
@\"FTP: \"@.  Most errors will be IO userErrors.  In a few extremely rare
cases, errors may be raised by the Prelude error function, though these
will also have a string beginning with @\"FTP: \"@.  Exceptions raised by
the underlying networking code will be passed on to you unmodified.
